# CAD Basics and Tutorials

This folder contains my CAD practice work and tutorials.  
It is designed to build foundational skills in **Fusion 360** and **Onshape**.

## Folder Structure

- Tutorials/ → Guided exercises from online tutorials or class material  
- PracticeModels/ → Small parts and assemblies created for skill practice  
- Notes/ → Any notes or observations about CAD techniques

## Screenshots

Each tutorial includes 3 screenshots:

- Isometric view  
- Top view  
- Side view

These demonstrate the geometry, constraints, and features learned in each exercise.
