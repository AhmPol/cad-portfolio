# Original CAD Projects

This folder contains my original mechanical designs and assemblies.  

## Folder Structure

- Each project has its own subfolder:

Example:

```
Design1_FRC_Robot/
  ├── Images/ → Screenshots and renders for presentation
  ├── Design1_Exports/ → STEP/STL files and renders
  └── README.md/ → Overview of the project
```


## How to Use

- Download the STEP files from the Exports folder to view in any CAD software (Fusion 360, Onshape, SolidWorks, FreeCAD).  
- Renders and images provide a visual overview of the project.
