# Original CAD Projects

This folder contains my original mechanical designs and assemblies.  

## Folder Structure

- Each project has its own subfolder:

Example:

Design1_FRC_Robot/
   - Design1_Original/ → Editable CAD files (.f3d, .sldprt, .sldasm)
   - Design1_Exports/ → STEP/STL files and renders
   - Images/ → Screenshots and renders for presentation


## How to Use

- Download the STEP files from the Exports folder to view in any CAD software (Fusion 360, Onshape, SolidWorks, FreeCAD).  
- Renders and images provide a visual overview of the project.
