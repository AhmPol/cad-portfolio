# FRC Robot Version 2

This is the second version of my FRC Robot, an iteration of Version 1 with an improved roller/elevator mechanism.

## Features

- **Drivetrain:** Same tank drive powered by 4 CIM motors  
- **Roller Mechanism:** Single long roller (similar to coral) replacing side-by-side rollers  
- **Elevator Integration:** Roller attached to elevator; can move at an angle while rolling  
- **Elevator:** Powered by 2 NEO motors for vertical movement  
- **Rollers:** 2 NEO-mini motors for other mechanisms as needed  

## Files

- **Exports/** → STEP/STL files of the updated assembly and components  
- **Images/** → Screenshots/renders showing angled roller positions and elevator movement

## Purpose

This version demonstrates:

- Iterative design improvements from Version 1  
- Enhanced roller/elevator mechanism for more efficient game piece handling  
- Understanding of motion and angled mechanism integration in mechanical design  

## Notes

- Main improvement: angled single long roller attached to the elevator  
- Focused on combining intake and movement efficiency in a single mechanism
