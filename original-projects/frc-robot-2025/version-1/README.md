# FRC Robot Version 1

This is the first version of my FRC Robot design, focused on a functional drivetrain and roller/elevator mechanism.

## Features

- **Drivetrain:** Tank drive powered by 4 CIM motors  
- **Roller Mechanism:** Side-by-side rollers (top and bottom) for handling game pieces  
- **Elevator:** Powered by 2 NEO motors for vertical movement  
- **Incline Plate:** Plate at the end of the robot with a roller for game piece intake  
- **Rollers:** 2 NEO-mini motors for top rollers

## Files

- **Exports/** → STEP/STL files of the robot assembly and individual components  
- **Images/** → Screenshots/renders of the robot from multiple angles (isometric, top, side)  

## Purpose

This version demonstrates:

- Mechanical design skills in FRC robotics  
- Integration of drivetrain, elevator, and roller mechanisms  
- Motor selection and power distribution for competitive robotics  

## Notes

- Rollers are positioned on top for mechanism functionality  
- Focused on creating a reliable first version for testing and assembly
